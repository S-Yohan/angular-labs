<h2>Parent to Child</h2>
<p>A parent component can use property binding to bind data to a child component, as demonstrated here.</p>
<p>In this case, dataFromParent is a variable belonging to the child component "input", and "var1", "var2" are variables
  belonging to this (parent) component. Notice this looks a bit like property binding. Your next task is going to be to
  pass another variable, "todoVar", into the child component's "todoInput" variable so that it can be displayed.
  this will require you to bind "todoVar" in the parent component's HTML template and to add the @Input() decorator over
  the child component's "todoInput" variable.</p>
<p>Update the first child component from the parent:</p>
<input type = "text" [(ngModel)]="var1">
<p>Update the second child component from the parent:</p>
<input type = "text" [(ngModel)]="var2">
<p>TODO: Update both child components to take in todoData from the parent:</p>
<input type = "text" [(ngModel)]="todoData">

<app-child [dataFromParent]="var1"></app-child>
<app-child [dataFromParent]="var2"></app-child>

<h2>Child to Parent</h2>
<p>If you recall the @Output annotation used in EventEmitters, it may also be used to send data from a child component
  to the parent. An event emitted by the EventEmitter can have some data attached to it, which can then be received by
  the parent component's handler for the custom event. Essentially,
  data can be passed from child to parent using event binding and passing data via an event.</p>
