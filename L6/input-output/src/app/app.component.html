<h1>Input & Output</h1>
<p>Managing state - whether it is the global state of an entire page (such as information about the currently
  logged in user) or the state of a single component (such as the amount of a particular item in a user's
  ecommerce shopping cart) is consistently one of the most difficult aspects of front-end development. Now that we have
  separated the functionality of our site across many components, we have to re-engineer how data can flow between
  components. We will refer to the relationship of a component rendering another component in its HTML template
  as parent and child components. Check out the 'parent' and 'child' components to see how data can be passed between
  them.</p>
<app-parent-to-child></app-parent-to-child>
<h2>Child to Parent</h2>
<p>If you recall the @Output annotation used in EventEmitters, it may also be used to send data from a child component
to the parent. An event emitted by the EventEmitter can have some data attached to it, which can then be received by
the parent component's handler for the custom event. This can be used for passing data from child to parent.</p>
<h2>Global state</h2>
<p>There are several approaches to global state storage, but we will be focusing on the simplest method:
simply put some variable in a singleton Object that is shared across the whole app. We will do this with Services
in a future lab.</p>
