<h2>Two-Way Binding</h2>
<p>Two-way binding is the combination of both event and property binding.
Generally, you'll only see two-way binding when working with some form of user input that performs live-updates on the
  site, such as autocomplete features, or changing text in multiple places as the user types in an input box.
  As you can see, the property-bound inputText1 is changed from live event updates from the input box. This is why
  this is referred to as two-way binding: Property binding and event binding are working simultaneously in tandem.
</p>
<input type = "text" [(ngModel)]="inputText1">
<p>{{inputText1}}</p>
<p>Now, replicate that behavior for inputText2:</p>
<input type = "text">
