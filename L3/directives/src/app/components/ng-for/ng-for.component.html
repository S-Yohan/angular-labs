<h2>ngFor</h2>
<p>Check out the component in src/app/components/ng-for to complete this lab.
  ngFor is like a for loop for HTML elements. It will generate an element for every item in an array.
You should define what to call an individual element, and provide the name of the array variable, in this case
we are going to iterate through every 'number' from the 'numbers' array.</p>
<div *ngFor="let number of numbers">
  <p>number: {{number}}</p>
</div>
<p>TODO: use ngFor to display all the names in the 'names' array.</p>
<div>
</div>
