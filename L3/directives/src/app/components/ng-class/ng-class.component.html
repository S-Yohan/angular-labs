<h2>ngClass</h2>
<p>Check out the component in src/app/components/ng-class to complete this lab.

  ngClass allows you to programmatically determine the class, or classes of a component. This allows Angular
to change the set of styling rules that are applied to a particular component. In this case, clicking this button
will change the class of this p component, swapping its color. You can find the component's styling rules in the
component's CSS file.</p>
<p [ngClass]="componentClass">I'm changing colors!</p>
<button (click) = switchComponentClass()>click to change component classes</button>
<p>TODO: apply the ngClass attribute directive to the following p tag as well, binding the ngClass directive to
  componentClass.</p>
<p>I want to change colors too!</p>
