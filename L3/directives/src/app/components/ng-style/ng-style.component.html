<h2>ngStyle</h2>
<p>Check out the component in src/app/components/ng-style to solve this lab. ngStyle allows the developer to
programmatically change the styling of a specific component. For instance, the style of this element was bound to
a TypeScript variable. The style rules are written as key-value pairs in TypeScript.</p>
<p [ngStyle]="{'font-size': fontSize}">I'm text</p>
<button (click)="increaseFontSize()">increase font size</button>
<p>Apply the same ngStyle rule to me</p>
