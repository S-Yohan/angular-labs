<h1>Lifecycle of a component</h1>
  <p>You may have noticed that the .ts file of every component has contained a method 'ngoninit'. This is a very useful
    method that will be used extensively in Angular components.</p>

  <p> Components get created, modified, and destroyed quite often, and it is often needed perform actions when these things
  happen. For instance, if a user on a social media site opens up a chat with their friend, we intend to load all
  previous chat messages when the chat box is first rendered. Or, the site persists user input when the user closes a
  text field as an autosave feature. To accomplish this, the developer needs to write code that will be executed
  whenever these events happen. We refer to this as the lifecycle of a component, and Angular provides specific methods
  that fire when these lifecycle events happen. They are referred to as lifecycle hooks.</p>
  <h2>ngOnInit</h2>
  <p>Provided within this component is the method 'ngOnInit'. Your task is going to be to update the CurrentTime
    variable with the current time when the component is first mounted. The easiest way to get the current time
    will be in milliseconds with dateTimestampProvider.now(), which is fine.</p>
  <h3>Current tme: {{time}}</h3>
  <p>This component is mounted when the page first loads, so you can just refresh the page to refresh the time.</p>
  <h2>ngOnDestroy</h2>
  <p>Then, your next task is going to be to write the behavior of 'ngOnDestroy'. ngOnDestroy will execute after a
  component is unmounted. This method should produce an alert such as 'Component Destroyed!' you can test this by
  clicking the buttons on the site, which are connected to a boolean value and an ngif which will unmount and mount the
  component.</p>
  <h2>ngOnChanges</h2>
  <p>You should also know about ngOnChange, which fires every time the component is updated, and when the component
    first mounts.</p>
