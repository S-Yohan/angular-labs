<h1>Services</h1>
<p>Services, like a Service class in your backend, contain logic which is essential to the operation of the site.
  Specifically, Angular Services allow the developer to separate logic that shouldn't logically be part of an individual
  component. For instance, they can be quite useful as a place to store methods that sends HTTP requests to your backend,
  and they are also a quite useful place to store and manipulate global, site-wide variables (think keeping track of a
  shopping cart, or keeping track of the currently logged in user).</p>

<p>In this case, a service "CountService" will contain a globally-stored number variable, which is incremented from the
  Incrementer component. Check out how the Service is introduced in the Incrementer component - it is injected into the
  component, in the component's constructor method, via a strategy called dependency injection. That means that when a
  Service is requested to be injected, Angular will instantiate it for the developer and make it usable within the
  component. One of the advantages here is that Services follow the Singleton design pattern, where Angular injects the
  same instance of the service into all components, so the "count" field of the service is able to act as if it's a
  global store shared across the application.</p>

<p>Your task will be to implement a decrementing functionality in the Service, as well as injecting it into the
  Decrementor component and properly calling the Service's decrementing function when the decrement button is clicked.
  This lab relies on EventEmitters, but the EventEmitters and event binding necessary have already been written. You
  only need to do the steps mentioned. The .ts files of the decrementor and incrementor, as well as the .ts file of the
  CountService in the services folder, will be of interest to you.<p>
