<h1>Models</h1>
<p>this lab uses an interface to create a model of a dog. It is accepted and common to use interfaces to model data
in Angular in the same way you would use model classes in other languages. An interface named 'dog' is provided, which
  contains name, breed, and age fields. This lab will require you to do is to fill in the addDog method, which takes
in data from the 2-way bound input fields on this page, creates a Dog model based off of the Dog interface, and
saves that to a service that acts as a site-wide global store of dogs (already provided.) The list of dogs will refresh
since it is assigned to the dogs array from the DogsService.</p>
<h2>Dog input</h2>
<p>name</p>
<input type = "text" [(ngModel)]="nameInput">
<p>breed</p>
<input type = "text" [(ngModel)]="breedInput">
<p>age</p>
<input type = "number" [(ngModel)]="ageInput">
<br>
<button (click) = "addDog()">submit dog</button>
<h2>All dogs</h2>
<div *ngFor="let dog of dogs">
  <p>dog name: {{dog.name}}, breed: {{dog.breed}}, age: {{dog.age}}</p>
</div>
